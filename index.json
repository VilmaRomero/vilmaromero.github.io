In 2008, the movement ecology framework (MEF Nathan et al. in PNAS 105(49):19052–19059, 2008) introduced an integrative theory of organismal movement—linking internal state, motion capacity, and navigation capacity to external factors—which has been recognized as a milestone in the field. Since then, the study of movement experienced a technological boom, which provided massive quantities of tracking data of both animal and human movement globally and at ever finer spatio-temporal resolutions. In this work, we provide a quantitative assessment of the state of research within the MEF, focusing on animal movement, including humans and invertebrates, and excluding movement of plants and microorganisms. Using a text mining approach, we digitally scanned the contents of $\u003e8000$ papers from 2009 to 2018 available online, identified tools and methods used, and assessed linkages between all components of the MEF. Over the past decade, the publication rate has increased considerably, along with major technological changes, such as an increased use of GPS devices and accelerometers and a majority of studies now using the R software environment for statistical computing. However, animal movement research still largely focuses on the effect of environmental factors on movement, with motion and navigation continuing to receive little attention. A search of topics based on words featured in abstracts revealed a clustering of papers among marine and terrestrial realms, as well as applications and methods across taxa. We discuss the potential for technological and methodological advances in the field to lead to more integrated and interdisciplinary research and an increased exploration of key movement processes such as navigation, as well as the evolutionary, physiological, and life-history consequences of movement.","tags":null,"title":"Recent trends in movement ecology of animals and human mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651170600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651170600,"objectID":"ac4e5f94a0d364747545a3dcebf04b1a","permalink":"https://vilmaromero.github.io/talk/aspirando-a-ser-una-data-scientist/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aspirando-a-ser-una-data-scientist/","section":"event","summary":"Un breve recorrido por el campo de Data Science","tags":["Data Scientist"],"title":"Aspirando a ser una Data Scientist","type":"event"},{"authors":["Ashly Guerrero","Juan Gutiérrez Cárdenas","Vilma Romero","Víctor H.

In Peru, 68.2% of women have been victims of violence, of which 31.7% were victims of physical aggression, 64.2% of psychological aggression, and 6.6% of sexual aggression. Therefore, in order to predict psychological, physical and sexual intimate partner violence in Peru, the database of denouncements registered in 2016 of the \"Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables\" was used. This database is comprised of 70510 complaints and 236 variables concerning the characteristics of the victim and the aggressor. First of all, we used Chi-squared feature selection technique to find the most influential variables. Next, we applied the SMOTE and random under sampling techniques to balance the dataset. Then, we processed the balanced dataset using cross validation with 10 folds on Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines classifiers to predict the type of partner violence and compare their results. The results indicate that the Multinomial Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers performed better on different scenarios with different feature subsets, whereas the Naïve Bayes classifier showed inferior. Finally, we observed that the classifiers improve their performance as the number of features increased.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of Classifiers Models for Prediction of Intimate Partner Violence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edgard Vargas Solís","Daniel Cárdenas Salas","Juan Gutiérrez Cárdenas","Vilma Romero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604102400,"objectID":"3d48d72c09b94a33891ea72ac685bcc7","permalink":"https://vilmaromero.github.io/publication/edgard2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/edgard2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in Peru constitute a risk for the population, that does not give it the importance that it should and does not take adequate measures to protect against it and to prevent skin injuries. This research aims to educate the general population about the high radiation levels registered in our country. To accomplish this objective, a virtual reality application was developed to visualize real time UV index, the maximum exposition time before getting a sunburn according to the user’s skin type, the potential skin damage, and, lastly, it provides a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) recommendation. To validate the research, a survey was applied to 63 participants, who were mostly between 18 and 24 years old, in two parts$:$ the first part (knowledge segment) was applied before the simulation took place in order to analyze the user’s knowledge level about the subject; and the second part (application segment) measured how valuable the application was in terms of education, usability and appeal. The survey results (p \u003c 0.001) indicate that most of the participants do not know or are indifferent to high UV radiation (knowledge segment), and that the virtual reality application educated the participants about the UV radiation problem (application segment, education component). There is evidence that virtual reality can be an effective method to teach people about a problem, being part of it, and observe the consequences.","tags":[],"title":"Virtual Reality Application to Teach Dangerous Over Exposure to UV Radiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Taller a cargo de Florencia D’Andrea, Juan Cruz Rodríguez y Vilma Romero\nSobre el taller\n¿Quieres generar una página web interactiva a partir de tu código de R?

Basically, the plot will display how each latent ability found for Theory of Mind is affected by all the other abilities at previous times (we have information for three times). The process to find the latent abilities is not the main interest of the post, but it could be the topic for the next post. So let’s get back to the point.\nData To obtain the data used for the path diagram, I employed a classical linear approach. Each latent ability at time 2 was regressed with all the abilities at time 1 including itself. Similarly, it was done for time 3 against time 2. Only the significant relations of each regression (p-value\u0026lt;0.05) were stored.\nmydata \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026#34;data_causal.txt\u0026#34;, header = TRUE, sep = \u0026#34;\\t\u0026#34;) A small sample of the data is shown in the following table:\nx xend y yend pval rsq x2 xend2 y2 yend2 1 2 6 6 0.000017 0.403304 1.05 1.95 6.00 6.00 1 2 5 6 0.004950 0.403304 1.05 1.95 5.05 5.95 2 3 5 1 0.041056 0.834008 2.05 2.95 4.80 1.20 2 3 1 1 0.000000 0.834008 2.05 2.95 1.00 1.00 x is the departure time. xend is the arrival time. y is the ability (eg. 6 = Non Verbal False Belief, 1 = Location Change) considered as dependent variable in the regression at time x. yend is the ability considered as independent variable in the regression at time xend. pval is the p-value of the relation between y and yend. rsq is the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of the regression. The last four variables (x2, xend2, y2, yend2) were created based on the first ones to have a better location to be considered in the plot.\nPlot First, let’s define a function that will help us to choose a pretty color.\ngg_color_hue \u0026lt;- function(n) { hues = seq(15, 375, length = n+1) hcl(h = hues, l = 65, c = 100)[1:n] } Finally, the code for the causal diagram is as follows:\nlibrary(ggplot2) ggplot(mydata) + geom_segment(aes(x = x2, y = y2, xend = xend2, yend = yend2, col = pval), alpha = 0.3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15,\u0026#34;inches\u0026#34;)), size = 0.8) + scale_color_gradient(high = \u0026#34;gray\u0026#34;, low = \u0026#34;black\u0026#34;, name = \u0026#34;p-value\u0026#34;) + geom_point(aes(x = xend, y = yend, size = rsq), col = gg_color_hue(4)[1]) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:3) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:6, labels = c(\u0026#34;Location Change\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Narrative\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Deceptive Box\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Verbal FB\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Pretense, Desire, Think\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Non Verbal FB\u0026#34;)) + labs(x = \u0026#34;Time\u0026#34;, y = NULL) + guides(size = guide_legend(title = expression(R^2))) Interpretation The red shaded circles stands for the goodness of fit, which in linear models is the $R^2$, and it varies according to its value. Additionally, the darker the arrow is, the more significant becomes the precedent ability in explaining the respective latent ability at this time point.\nIt can be clearly seen that Pretense, Desire and Think can be explained at Time 2 by the same abilities and Non Verbal False Believe abilities had at Time 1. The same pattern is looked for Non Verbal False Belief at Time 2 which is summarised by its previous ability and the Pretense, Desire and Think ability at Time 1. However, these last causality is less accurate since its $R^2$ value is smaller. Even though there is an arrow from Location Change ability at Time 1 to Verbal False Belief ability at Time 2 indicating causality, it is not that much significant ($p-value \\approx 0.05$) and also the $R^2$ is around 50%. The remaining abilities at Time 2 are as well explained by themselves at Time 1.\nAt Time 3, all the abilities are caused by their previous time point value. The remarkable pattern is shown by Pretense, Desire and Think at Time 2 explaining three dimensions at Time 3 apart form itself: Non Verbal False Belief, Dceptive Box and Location Change. These last with not a strong p-value but it still having a good precision ($R^2$ around 0.8). Moreover, Non Verbal False Belief ability seem to be explained also by the Narrative factor, but the significance is almost at the boundary and can be because the p-values, in general, have not been adjusted for multiple comparison.\n","date":1487030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487030400,"objectID":"fa9e3676eb381081238b9bd041e8f988","permalink":"https://vilmaromero.github.io/post/2017-02-14-causal-diagram/","publishdate":"2017-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-02-14-causal-diagram/","section":"post","summary":"In this post, I would like to introduce a customized ggplot2 graphic that I did for my master dissertation.

To remain competitive, the companies look for satisfying the needs of customers by meeting market requirements. In this context, Process Capability Indices (PCI) play a crucial role in assessing the quality of processes. In the case of non-normal data there are two general approaches based on transformations (Box-Cox and Johnson Transformation) and Percentiles (Pearson’s and Burr’s Distribution Systems). However, previous studies on the comparison of these methods show different conclusions, and thus arises the need to clarify the differences between these methods to implement a proper estimation of these indices. In this paper, a simulation study is made in order to compare the above methods and to propose an appropriate methodology for estimating the PCI in non-normal data. Furthermore, it is concluded that the best method used depends on the type of distribution, the asymmetry level of the distribution and the ICP value.","tags":null,"title":"Methodology for the estimation of Capability Indices in Processes with non normal data","type":"publication"}]
